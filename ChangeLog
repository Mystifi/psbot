* PSBot 0.2.0, 15 October 2017
  - Fix method typos found within lib/psbot/pattern.rb and lib/psbot/user_list.rb
  - Consolidate PSBot::Room methods for getting room auth into +PSBot::Room#all_auth+.
    Usage of the aforementioned methods will print a deprecation warning, and will
    call the new method.
  - Consolidate the base for messages in +PSBot::Room#send+ and +PSBot::User#send+
    instead of +PSBot::Message#reply+. This allows users to write plugins utilising
    the former methods without having to write `room.send("#{room.name}|#{text}")`,
    which goes against the fact that the Room/User classes should handle how messages
    are formatted.
  - Remove a require statement to a nonexistent file from lib/psbot/bot.rb, probably
    left over from the IRC bot -> PS! bot modification.
  - Add the event +:connect+ to available events that triggers upon the receiving of
    the second |updateuser| message, which is sent when the bot logs in to its given
    username. This allows any written plugins to use Cinch's `listen_to :connect` hook,
    which avoids any `listen_to :updateuser` hooks firing twice.
  - Note that these are breaking changes.

* PSBot 0.1.0, 5 April 2017
